# Teaching Materials

This repository contains a curated collection of teaching materials I created while serving as a Teaching Assistant (TA) at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)**.  
These documents were prepared for undergraduate statistics courses and include full tutorial problem sets, worked solutions, concept explanations, and exam review materials.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to communicate complex statistical concepts clearly, prepare structured teaching resources, and support students' learning effectively.

## Course: STAT4005 – Time Series Analysis

STAT4005 is an upper-level undergraduate course focusing on:

- AR, MA, and ARMA models  
- Stationarity and dependence structure  
- Forecasting methods  
- Parameter estimation  
- Model selection  
- Volatility modelling (ARCH/GARCH)  
- Unit-root and non-stationary processes  

The tutorial materials below were designed to help students develop both intuition and technical proficiency.
